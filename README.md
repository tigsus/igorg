# IGORG

This is the GitHub home page for IGORG-related public-private source code collaboration efforts. IGORG-based projects have a mission to benefit NRECA-member electric cooperatives by promoting and coordinating programming resources that facilitate IT Governance, Security and Compliance.  

## Joining

If you are a NRECA-member electric cooperative, email `join@igorg.org` and specify which project you would like to join. A list of projects can be found below. Please provide the following:

* Project to join
* GitHub usernames so we can link them to the project
* Name of your electric cooperative
* Designated contact person (which could be you or a different individual in the organization)

## Projects and Licensing

Projects fall under a few licensing types. Public projects typically have an MIT or Apache2 license attributed to them. Private projects are Co-op centric with licensing ranging from `MIT for NRECA Members` to `proprietary`. A project may be categorized as proprietary if it contains commercial software or trade-secrets.

##### Private Projects
