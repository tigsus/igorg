# IGORG Style-Guides

The sub-directories contain style guides for IGORG-related projects. If the style-guides are referenced from existing third party projects, attribute proper licensing. For example, `jshttp` [style-guide](https://github.com/jshttp/style-guide) is used by the Express JS team for a number of projects and it is public domain.
